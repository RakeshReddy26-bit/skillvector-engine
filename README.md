# SkillVector

SkillVector is an experimental engine that turns resumes and job descriptions into **clear skill gaps, learning paths, and real proof of ability**.

The goal is simple:  
stop guessing skills from resumes and start working with evidence.

This project is early, opinionated, and built step by step as a real system — not a demo.

## Why This Exists

Hiring today relies too much on weak signals:
- resumes full of keywords
- vague skill claims
- subjective interviews
- inconsistent evaluations

On the other side, candidates don’t know:
- what skills they’re actually missing
- what to learn next
- how to prove what they know in a way hiring managers trust

SkillVector sits in the middle.

It asks:
> “What skills does this role really need, what does this person actually have, and what proof would convince someone?”

## What SkillVector Does (Today)

Given:
- a resume (plain text)
- a target job description

SkillVector produces:
- a match score
- a learning priority
- missing skills
- an ordered learning path
- concrete project-based evidence ideas

Everything is structured, inspectable, and designed to evolve.
